# Slot Machine Game

This is a versatile slot machine game with two different versions: a classic **terminal-based application** and a modern **web-based interface**.

## Terminal-Based Version

This version is built entirely with Python and runs directly in your command-line terminal. It demonstrates core Python programming concepts, including:
-   User input handling
-   Game logic and state management
-   Basic terminal-based interaction

### How to Play (Terminal Version)

1.  Run the `main.py` file from your terminal.
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts to deposit money, set your bet, and spin the reels.

-   Responsive web design
-   Client-side game logic (JavaScript)
-   DOM manipulation and event handling
-   Aesthetic and user-friendly design

### How to Play (Web Version)

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

-   **Python:** Core programming, control flow, and functions.
-   **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
-   **HTML & CSS:** Semantic markup, responsive design, and modern styling.
-   **Git & GitHub:** Version control, collaborative development, and project documentation.

This project highlights the ability to adapt a core concept across different platforms and demonstrates a strong foundation in both back-end and front-end development.
